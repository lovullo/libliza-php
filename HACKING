Hacking libliza-php
===================
These are general notes to internal developers of libliza-php.


Local Development
-----------------
For local development, setting up a symlink to the project using libliza-php
is easiest.  For example:

```
$ rm -rf ~/gitrepos/project/vendor/lovullo/libliza-php
$ ln -s ~/gitrepos/libliza-php !:2
```


Deploying To Packagist
----------------------
Packagist is set up to monitor tags to the GitHub repository.
To trigger this, simply push to the github remote:

```
# if you don't already have it set up
$ git remote add github git@github.com:lovullo/libliza-php

$ git push github && git push github --tags
```
